--- STEPS TO FOLLOW ---

1. Copy the folder(or file) to the server path (localhost/ webserver) [only one file is needed to run the application 'index.php']
2. Go to localhost/pass-sorter-php in the browser
3. To check the working example please visit https://sabinchacko.com/pass-sorter-php/

--- Complexity of the Algorithm ---
The Algorithm is having complexity of O(n)


--- Assumptions --
It is assumed that the 'from' or 'to' of the correct route is not duplicated. To keep the complexity of O(n) this assumption is made.
